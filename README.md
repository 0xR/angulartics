angulartics
===========

Vendor-agnostic analytics for AngularJS applications.

# Minimal setup

## Setup with Google Analytics ##

    angular.module('myApp', ['angulartics', 'angulartics.ga'])

You also need to embed the JS code provided by Google Analytics:

    <script>
      (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
      (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
      m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
      })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
    
      ga('create', 'UA-10255892-8', 'luisfarzati.github.io');
      ga('send', 'pageview'); // <-- DELETE THIS LINE!
    </script>
    
Done. All navigation done across your application pages (ng-views) will be automatically tracked as pageviews.

## Setup with Kissmetrics ##

    angular.module('myApp', ['angulartics', 'angulartics.km'])

You also need to embed the JS code provided by Kissmetrics:

	<script type="text/javascript">
	  var _kmq = _kmq || [];
	  var _kmk = _kmk || 'a41242214c6f8c693b4c8a59fa8f981e13549deb';
	  function _kms(u){
	    setTimeout(function(){
	      var d = document, f = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0],
	      s = d.createElement('script');
	      s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.async = true; s.src = u;
	      f.parentNode.insertBefore(s, f);
	    }, 1);
	  }
	  _kms('//i.kissmetrics.com/i.js');
	  _kms('//doug1izaerwt3.cloudfront.net/' + _kmk + '.1.js');
	</script>

Done. All navigation done across your application pages (ng-views) will be automatically tracked as pageviews (actually, as events named "Pageview"; their API doesn't seem to support pageview tracking programatically).

## Are there any additional providers?

Not yet. I'll be adding support for more providers in short-term, and your contribution is most welcomed :) If there's no Angulartics plugin for your analytics vendor of choice, please feel free to write yours and PR' it!  

# Playing around 

## Disabling virtual pageview tracking

If you want to keep pageview tracking for its traditional meaning (whole page visits only), set virtualPageviews to false:

	angular.module('myApp', ['angulartics', 'angulartics.ga'])
	.config(function($analyticsProvider) {
		$analyticsProvider.virtualPageviews(false);     

## Programmatic tracking

Use the $analytics service to emit pageview and event tracking:

	module.controller('SampleCtrl', function($analytics) {
		// emit pageview beacon with path /my/url
	    $analytics.pageTrack('/my/url');

		// emit event track (without properties)
	    $analytics.eventTrack('eventName');

		// emit event track (with category and label properties for GA)
	    $analytics.eventTrack('eventName', { 
	      category: 'category', label: 'label'
    }); 

## Declarative tracking

Use `analytics-on` and `analytics-event` attributes for enabling event tracking on a specific HTML element:

	<a href="file.pdf" 
		analytics-on="click" 
		analytics-event="Download">Download</a>

`analytics-on` lets you specify the DOM event that triggers the event tracking; `analytics-event` is the event name to be sent. 

Additional properties (for example, category as required by GA) may be specified by adding `analytics-*` attributes:

	<a href="file.pdf" 
		analytics-on="click" 
		analytics-event="Download"
		analytics-category="Content Actions">Download</a>
